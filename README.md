# Developing an Efficient Clothing Classification Model using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)

This repository contains the code and resources for developing an efficient clothing classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify different types of clothing items based on images.

The model works on the Fashion MNIST dataset which can be downloaded from the following link
